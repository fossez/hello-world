Learning with theodinproject
I have no clue what I am doing but am happy I'm doing it. My training is in the medical field but I am hoping to transition to web design. I may in the future use this knowledge for nursing informatics. But design, art, photography, and anything outdoors are my passions and if I can make a career out of any of these I'm all for it. I see web design as a creative art. I hope to use it to help others for my church, hospitals, or other fun projects.
